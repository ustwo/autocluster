# Autocluster Codebase

## Overview

The Autocluster project is an innovative exploration into the future of automotive instrument clusters. Inspired by ustwo's thought-piece "Re-imagining the instrument cluster in cars," this repository hosts web-based prototypes that envision the future of driver information systems. The prototypes include:

- An unbranded archetype of an instrument cluster.
- A concept cluster UI inspired by Ferrari California.
- A concept cluster UI inspired by Mercedes Benz S-class.
- An adaptive UI prototype utilizing headtracking to adjust viewing angles.

These prototypes serve as a sandbox for ideas and experimentation, pushing the boundaries of design and functionality in automotive UI.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:
- Node.js (Version X.X or above)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autocluster.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd autocluster
3. Install dependencies:
   npm install
4. Run the prototype of your choice (instructions specific to each prototype can be found in their respective folders).

## Tools and Technologies

- FramerJS: Utilized for rapid prototyping and experimentation. Learn more at http://framerjs.com/.
- PaperJS: Employed for sophisticated vector graphics scripting. Learn more at http://paperjs.org/.
- Headtrackr JS: A library for real-time face and head tracking, crucial for the adaptive UI prototype. Learn more at https://github.com/auduno/headtrackr/.

We welcome contributions from the community! If you're interested in enhancing the Autocluster prototypes or have ideas for new features, please feel free to comment, contribute to the codebase, and build on them. Attribution to ustwo is much appreciated.
